## About
Laravel, a PHP framework for web development, can be integrated with the HTML5-QRCode library to add QR code scanning functionality to web applications. By including the HTML5-QRCode library and creating a route and controller method in Laravel, developers can utilize the device's camera to scan QR codes. The library provides an API to initiate the camera stream and listen for QR code detection events. The scanned QR code data can then be processed and stored in a database or used for specific actions within the Laravel application. By incorporating this integration, developers can easily enhance their web applications with the ability to scan and utilize QR codes.
